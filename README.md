# SUACE
Speeded Up Adaptive Contrast Enhancement (SUACE); an OpenCV based contrast enhancement technique. 

SUACE is an image contrast enhancement algorithm which is originally invented for enhancing infrared vein images. But SUACE can be used in any application which requires real-time contrast enhancement.

## Features:
1. Real-time processing
2. Simultaneous Illumination normalization
3. Regulated boosting for details

## How to Use:
This implementation requires openCV 2.x. Add the SUACE.cpp and SUACE.h to the working space and compile with any c++ compiler.
An example code is in example.cpp.
